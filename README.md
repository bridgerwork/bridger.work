## Reporting issues on github

It's fairly intuitive. If you see something that needs a'fixin, have an idea, or even just have a question about something:
1. Go to the issues tab at the top ðŸ‘†
1. Check to see if there's already an issue for what you're thinking
2. If not, click on the big 'Create issue' button
94. Add labels, assign it to someone, link it to a milestone, project or pull request

## Contributing
If you want to get into the code, or make updates to content, then create a new branch, make your changes, and then open a pull request.
If you don't know what any of that means, then talk to jeff, read some [guides](https://guides.github.com), or watch some [videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/GitHubGuides/featured).

Thank you. Come again.
